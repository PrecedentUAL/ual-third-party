## UAL Third Party

Code and assets for University of the Arts London third-party websites.

[View boilerplate](http://artslondon.github.io/ual-third-party/)

# Features

- Simple boilerplate with branding
- Inline CSS
- Supports order browsers using [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)
- Platform-agnostic

# Guidelines

- Always contact the UAL Digital Team when planning your site.
- We will supply you with additional documentation specifying colourways, font stacks, and other preferred design patterns.
- You must retain the supplied header and footer and the inline CSS as indicated in the comments. Note that you don't have to retain the Compass Reset CSS; equally feel free to use [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) if you need more than just the Shiv script.

# Example integrations

- [Connect](http://connect.arts.ac.uk/) is a really simple integration with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Note that the site references the TWBS CSS first, followed by the UAL inline CSS, to ensure correct presentation.
