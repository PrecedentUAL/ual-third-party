## UAL Third Party

 The University of the Arts London Digital Team provides this package of code and assets for branded third-party websites. It is designed to be a starting point for external developers to build a UAL-branded interface for their software.

# Features

- Simple HTML5 boilerplate with branding
- Inline CSS
- Compatible with >= IE8
- Supports older browsers using [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv)
- Platform-agnostic

# Guidelines

- Always contact the UAL Digital Team when planning your site.
- We will supply you with additional documentation specifying colourways, font stacks, and other preferred design patterns.
- You must retain the supplied header and footer and the inline CSS as indicated in the comments. Note that you don't have to retain the Compass Reset CSS; equally feel free to use [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) if you need more than just the Shiv script.
- We have illustrated an example horizontal nav for use in your projects. This can of course be supplemented with additional navigation. The only rule is none of your navigation sits inside the .ual-header container. 
- Responsive builds will require your own media queries. For example, you may prefer to collapse the .horizontal-menu to a hamburger icon below 480px.

# Example integrations

- [Connect](http://connect.arts.ac.uk/) is a really simple integration with [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Note that the site references the TWBS CSS first, followed by the UAL inline CSS, to ensure correct presentation.
